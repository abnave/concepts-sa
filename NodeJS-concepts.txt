Here's a brief overview of how Node.js achieves concurrency:

Event Loop: At the core of Node.js is an event loop, which is responsible for managing all the asynchronous operations. The event loop continuously checks for events and executes the associated callbacks when an event occurs.

Non-Blocking I/O: Node.js utilizes non-blocking I/O operations, which means that when an I/O operation, such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request, is initiated, Node.js doesn't block the execution of other code while waiting for the operation to complete. Instead, it registers a callback function and continues executing the next statements.

Callbacks and Event-driven Programming: When an I/O operation completes, Node.js invokes the corresponding callback function, which allows the application to continue processing the result. This approach is known as event-driven programming because the flow of the program is determined by events and their associated callbacks.

Asynchronous APIs: Node.js provides a wide range of asynchronous APIs for various tasks, such as file system operations, network communication, and database access. These APIs are designed to work seamlessly with the event loop and allow developers to write non-blocking code.

Worker Threads: Although Node.js is single-threaded, it also provides a Worker Threads module that allows you to create additional threads to perform CPU-intensive tasks. These worker threads can run parallel to the main event loop and improve performance in scenarios where heavy computation is involved.


Promises:
Promises in JavaScript are a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations and managing the flow of asynchronous code.
